* **Personal Introduction:** A focused hero banner introducing my academic background and engineering focus alongside a clean portrait graphic.
* **Project Cards:** Dedicated showcase blocks highlighting technical work with preview images, concise summaries, and project links.
* **Smart Contact Form:** Interactive form fields equipped with front-end validation rules for names, emails, and message lengths.
* **Accessibility Built-In:** Includes an invisible skip-to-content link for keyboard users and ARIA labels for screen readers.

**Responsive CSS**

* **Flexible Grids:** Built purely with CSS Grid and Flexbox so project cards and layouts adapt naturally to any screen size without heavy libraries.
* **Mobile-Friendly:** Spacing and text scale smoothly across mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.

**JavaScript Interactions**

* **Dark / Light Mode:** A one-click toggle that adapts to the visitor's device settings and remembers their chosen theme across visits.
* **Dynamic Time Greeting:** Welcomes visitors with a personalized greeting ("Good morning", "Good afternoon") based on their local time.
* **Instant Form Feedback:** Submissions are handled smoothly in the browser, showing an immediate confirmation note without page reloads.
* **Automatic Footer Year:** Automatically reflects the current year so the copyright never goes out of date.

## AI Integration Summary
AI tools (Claude and Gemini) were used during development to assist in designing layout structures (CSS Grid and Flexbox), testing color themes, and debugging terminal Git sync issues. All final code, portfolio descriptions, and styling were manually reviewed, edited, and customized.
Full details are documented in [docs/ai-usage-report.md](docs/ai-usage-report.md).
